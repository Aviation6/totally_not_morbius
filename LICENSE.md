# LICENSE

## Terms

So basically as opposed to licensing everything under one license, it's divided into 3

### Code

The code is licensed under zlib

### Writing

Any writing unrelated to morbius is under CC-BY 3.0 or later

### Morbius

I don't actually have a license to use Morbius but since this is not monetised it's probably ok and falls under fair use. Just bare this in mind when using Morbius
